when the cost function depends on only one variable, we call it one-dimensional gradient descent.
In this case, the cost function can be written as
𝐶=𝐶(𝑥)

Since there is only one variable, the gradient is not a vector. It is simply the derivative of the cost function,
dx/dC

This derivative represents the slope of the cost function curve at a particular point.

*If the slope is positive, the cost increases towards the right, so we move left to reduce the cost.
*If the slope is negative, the cost decreases towards the right, so we move right.
*We keep updating the value until the slope becomes zero, which indicates the minimum of the cost function.

So, in one dimension, gradient descent works by moving along the curve in the direction of decreasing slope until the minimum is reached.
